# Executive Summary
During the Fall and Spring Semester of the academic year 2021-2022, ten Mechanical, Electrical
and Computer Engineering Students will collaborate to design, build, and operate a lunar rover
robot which will compete in the NASA RMC: Lunabotics Competition 2022. The project is also
in the realm of the San Diego State University Capstone Senior Design Program. Participation in
this competition not only allows the team to use what they have learned at SDSU outside of the
classroom, but it also allows them to come up with inventive solutions to one of today's most
difficult technological challenges.
This project's rover will be able to maneuver through a simulated lunar environment and dig
through a layer of BP-1 to retrieve simulated lunar regolith material beneath it. The rover
will need to avoid obstacles in this arena, including stones and artificial craters, without using the
arena walls to map the field bounds. The competition's final will take place in May 2022 at
NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the goal of extracting a minimum of 1kg of lunar
regolith in each of two 15-minute trials. The more gravel removed, the more points the rover
receives, allowing it to finish higher in the competition.
The grading rubric is based on numerous systems, each with its own level of difficulty, with the
highest level of difficulty receiving the most points. Inspection, gravel mining, average
bandwidth consumption, mining robot mass, robot energy spent, dust tolerance design, dust
tolerant operation, and autonomy are examples of these systems.
